                <p>I'm a workaholic student, programmer, and graphic designer.<br>
                    Fueled by a passion for making a difference at UCSD, I'm committed to <br>
                    several campus organizations including ACM AI, VGDC, and <br>
                    the <span>San Diego Supercomputer Center.</span> 

                    <br>
                    Outside of school, I enjoy exploring San Diego with my friends, <br>
                    playing the piano, and making digital illustrations.

            <h2>Tips for Excelling in School</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>Classes</summary>
                <p>
                    Start early, and often. It's a phrase that's been ingrained into me as a student <br>
                    to who took CSE classes. It applies to any area of life. If you put in the <br>
                    work early, you save yourself time and energy down the road. But at the <br>
                    same time, make sure to balance the load. Only do what you believe you can do <br>
                    within your means. 
                </p>

                <aside>
                    If you do take CSE classes, I highly recommend CSE166 (Image Processing), CSE110 (Software Engineering) <br>
                    CSE130 (Functional Programming), and CSE167 (Computer Graphics), 
                </aside>

                <summary>Social Life</summary>
                <p>
                    I heard from several sources that UCSD is socially dead, but I disagree. Here's a few pointers on how <br>
                    to optimize your social life as a student.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you're living on campus, your roommates are the best way to make friends</li>
                    <li>I found that stepping away from work and hanging out with people often helped me appreciate having a community</li>
                    <li>Partying is awesome. You'll meet lot's of people</li>
                    <li>Join clubs and attend their events! A lot of orgs host bonfires, socials, and workshops where you can meet other students</li>
                </ol>
              </details>
              
              <br>

              <details>
                <summary>Internships</summary>
                <p>
                    Unlike a lot of people, I didn't land my first internship until my junior year. <br>
                    It was a struggle and I made a lot of mistakes. I spent many days asking myself <br>
                    where I wanted to go into. Research? Tutoring? Maybe a real internship off campus? I explored <br>
                    each route and was met with only more questions and confusion. What I realized is to just <br>
                    follow your heart and do what interests you. Moreover, don't be afraid of rejection; it's <br>
                    natural. But with time and patience, your hard work will pay off. Don't feel pressured to <br>
                    shadow other people. Your journey is unique so make it yours.
                </p>
