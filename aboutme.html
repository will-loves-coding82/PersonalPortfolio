                <p>I'm a workaholic student, programmer, and graphic designer.<br>
                    Fueled by a passion for making a difference at UCSD, I'm committed to <br>
                    several campus organizations including ACM AI, VGDC, and <br>
                    the <b>San Diego Supercomputer Center.</b> 

                    <br>
                    Outside of school, I enjoy exploring San Diego with my friends, <br>
                    playing the piano, and making digital illustrations.
