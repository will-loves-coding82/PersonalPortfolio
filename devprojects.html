                        <h3>Flow Trails</h3>
                        <p>
                            I was inspired to start this project after seeing other programmers make procedural/generative designs using code.<br/>
                            The purpose of this was to test how vector fields could manipulate objects in space as they moved across the plane, <br/>
                            and see what behaviors arose from an aggregate of forces. Each canvas initializes a thousand objects whose<br>
                            physical properties are constantly being updated in relation to the force at each point. It takes some simple vector <br/>
                            operations to get this working, but the end result is spectacular. Above is a screenshot of how the forces guide the <br/>
                            objects' paths over time. I added some nice trails to add some nice flow-y-ness to it.<br/>
                            Kind of reminds me of a seabed of anemone.

                        <h3>Truchet Tiles</h3>
                        <p>
                            I learned about truchet tiles about a year ago when I was watching a youtuber make these from scratch.<br/>
                            Basically, these are tiles that are rotationally asymmetric, meaning that you don't get the same shape<br/>
                            after rotations. When assembled together, they can form varied patterns depending on each tile's<br/>
                            orientation. Being the creative genius I am, I did look to the internet for help, but it was pretty amazing<br/>
                            to see intricate patterns emerge nothing from randomness. The one above uses tiles made out of<br/> 
                            quarter circles and lines.

                        <h3>Ploygon SubDivision</h3>
                        <p>
                            During my fall quarter as a junior, I was browsing Pinterest for natural scenery when I eventually dived into a whole world<br/>
                            of farm landscapes. I was captivated by the recursive relationship of different plots of agriculture and the<br>
                            repeating colors of each section. I wanted to reimagine this with code, so I found an algorithm that enabled me<br/>
                            to take a canvas and subdivide it several times along its width and height. With a dash of color here and some tweaks to<br>
                            the striations, I ended up with this. Try it out with the link below. You'll notice that each iteration is unique and<br/> 
                            and varies in their palette as well. I hope you find it fun and engaging to use!
